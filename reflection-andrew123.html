      <h1>Reflection on OOP in JavaScript</h1>
      <p>
        In this subject, I learned about Object-Oriented Programming or OOP using JavaScript. At first, I found it a bit confusing, but after doing activities and examples, I started to get it. OOP helped me write code in a better and more organized way by using classes and objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned that a class is like a plan or guide where I can create many objects that are almost the same. It helped me avoid repeating code and made things easier to understand. I also learned terms like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These were hard at first, but with practice, I saw how they make coding more efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of OOP, I became more confident in programming. I now think more about how I build my code and how everything connects. It was also helpful in group work because we could divide tasks using different parts of the code. I now understand how developers create big projects, and Iâ€™m happy I learned OOP because I know it will help me in the future.
