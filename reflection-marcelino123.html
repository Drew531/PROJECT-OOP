      <h1>Reflection on OOP in JavaScript</h1>
      <p>
        In this subject, I learned about Object-Oriented Programming or OOP using JavaScript. At first, I didn’t really understand what it meant, but as we did more activities, I slowly understood how useful it is. OOP made it easier for me to organize my code by using classes and objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I discovered that classes work like templates or blueprints. Instead of repeating code, I can use a class to create multiple objects with the same structure. This helped me save time and made my code cleaner. I also learned about encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism — these were hard to understand at first, but I saw how they help control how code is reused and updated.
      </p>
      <p>
        OOP helped me become more confident in coding. It made me think more carefully about how I design my programs, and it also helped me work better in group projects. Each of us could work on our own parts using different classes without messing up the main code. I now understand how big programs are made step-by-step using OOP, and I’m excited to use what I learned in the future.
